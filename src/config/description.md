seminar: The Global Lunch Seminar is an open event where any student can freely
  choose a topic and give a short presentation during lunchtime. It provides a
  casual, welcoming setting to practice presentation skills in front of a small
  audience, while sharing ideas, experiences, or interests.
hlh: The Happy Lunch Hour is a special lunchtime gathering where students come
  together to share a meal. Sometimes international students cook dishes from
  their home countries creating a warm and friendly atmosphere to enjoy food,
  culture, and conversation.
outbound: The Outbound Exchange Program gives our students the chance to travel
  abroad and experience life in another country. By joining the activities at
  the IFR, students can practice English, interact with international friends,
  and learn about different cultures in a friendly environment. These
  experiences make it easier and more natural to prepare for your travel, while
  also building confidence and curiosity for life overseas.
inbound: The International Friendship Room plays a central role in welcoming
  inbound exchange students each year. During the two to three week program,
  volunteers support the visitors by helping them adjust, make friends, and
  experience daily life in Japan. Through these activities, the IFR provides a
  warm and friendly environment that makes international students feel at home
  from the very beginning.
cultural: Cultural Exchange events give students the chance to share and
  experience traditions from around the world. Activities may include learning
  about local customs, trying on traditional clothing such as kimono, listening
  to music performances like the Japanese koto, or simply exchanging stories
  about everyday life in different countries. These events create a welcoming
  space to celebrate diversity and deepen mutual understanding.
friendship: Beyond formal events and programs, the International Friendship Room
  is also a place where genuine connections are made. Special Moments
  highlight the casual side of student life—sharing meals, laughing together,
  and building friendships that often extend beyond campus. These are the
  memories that capture the true spirit of the IFR.
